# Careers in Code Open Seminars

You’ll learn some of the [prep work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gwBAH4vbur9GdpnOjt12nrD7rdmWxZJXp5vqyzvhqeQ/edit) that went into applying for the first cohort of Careers in Code. 

In particular, you’ll explore the fundamentals of web development. You’ll learn the building blocks of the web, HTML, CSS, and Javascript while exploring common developer tools and troubleshooting/debugging practices.

Here are the key objectives we’ll cover:
- Basic HTML and CSS
- Basic Javascirpt
- Basic Command Line / UNIX (navigating file structures, configuring environments)
- Basic Version Control with Git & GitHub

In addition, you'll learn:

By the end of these open seminars, you’ll create a simple 2-3 page website, push it to GitHub, and deploy it to a static site generator (i.e. GitHub pages or Netlify).
